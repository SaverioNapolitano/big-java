# big-java
My solutions to some of the exercises of Cay Horstmann's "Big Java: Early Objects" book (7/e) 

# How is it organized?
Exercises are split into practice exercises and programming projects, according to the book's categorization. 

Both practice exercises and programming projects have a package for each chapter of the book.

Each exercise is named following the one it has on the book.

# How can I contribute?
If you want to add your solution of missing exercises you can clone this repository and just modify it. 

If you find problems on some exercises in the repository you can open a pull request. 

Be coherent with the names of packages and exercises.
